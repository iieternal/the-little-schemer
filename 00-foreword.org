* Foreword

The importance of requiring the knowledge of a number of processes
and the ability to visualize how they operate in concert is described.

* Preface
  
** Recursion

Recursion is the act of defining an object or solving a problem in
terms of (a smaller or modified version) of the original problem.

** Programming as a middle ground between natural languages and mathematics

# They share with mathematics the ability to give a formal
# meaning to a set of symbols. But unlike mathematics, programming
# languages can be directly experienced-you can take the programs in
# this book, observe their behavior, modify them, and experience the
# effect of these modifications.
   
In this sense, I think programs can be thought of as manifest
mathematics which can lead to experience Math through other senses
than just by seeing symbols and unravelling them in your head. This
invokes the metaphor, computers as an exobrain for Mathematics
