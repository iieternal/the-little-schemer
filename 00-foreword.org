* Foreword

The importance of requiring the knowledge of a number of processes
before becoming creative in a medium is detailed.

The importance of doing analysis is detailed:

# One can not even begin to think about organizing a great photograh
# without having the skills to make it happen. In engineering, as in
# other creative arts, we must learn to do analysis to support our
# effort in synthesis. One cannot build a beautiful and functional
# bridge without a knowledge of steel and dirt and considerable
# mathematical technique for using this knowledge to compute the
# properties of structures. Similarly, one cannot build a beautiful
# computer system without a deep understanding of how to
# "previsualize" the process generated by teh procedures one writes.

# Some photographers choose to use black-and-white 8xlO plates while
# others choose 35mm slides. Each has its advantages and
# disadvantages. Like photography, programming requires a choice of
# medium. Lisp is the medium of choice for people who enjoy free style
# and flexibility. Lisp was initially conceived as a theoretical vehicle
# for recursion theory and for symbolic algebra. It has developed into a
# uniquely powerful and flexible family of software development tools,
# providing wrap-around support for the rapid-prototyping of software
# systems.

# In Lisp, procedures are first-class data, to be passed as arguments,
# returned as values, and stored in data structures. This flexibility is
# valuable, but most importantly, it provides mechanisms for
# formalizing, naming, and saving the idioms-the common patterns of
# usage that are essential to engineering design. In addition, Lisp
# programs can easily manipulate the representations of Lisp programs a
# feature that has encouraged the development of a vast structure of
# program synthesis and analysis tools, such as cross-referencers.

I'm guessing that the Lisp modifying Lisp that is mentioned here is
the macro feature but not sure what cross-referencers constructed out
of it are.
